Soul Deep: On Jonathan, Faithfulness, and Tormented Family Systems
===============================================================

Summary: Through this paper, I offer a reading of the biblical figure Jonathan through the lens of family systems theory, exploring how Jonathan functions within a high-stress emotionally interdependent system. In addition to interpretations of Jonathan as a moral exemplar, cautionary figure, and identity icon, I suggest that his steadfastness could be understood as “secure attachment” and “emotional differentiation.”  Specifically, I argue that Jonathan’s relationship with his covenant-partner David functions as a stabilizing emotional base that enables him to remain present to his father Saul without being overtaken by Saul’s collapse.

I. Introduction

Why Jonathan?
Jonathan is a perplexing and underexplored figure in biblical theology, and interpretative traditions of Jonathan often fall within three groups: Jonathan as an exemplar of piety, Jonathan as a cautionary tale of staying with harmful relatives, and Jonathan as an icon of queer biblical hermeneutics.
Through a family systems reading, we can focus on another layer: Jonathan as part of a family.
1 Samuel can read, in many ways, like a case study in relational stress. Saul’s household is marked by intensifying instability: divine rejection, political fragility, emotional volatility, and the slow unraveling of authority.
Within this volatile system, Jonathan stands out, not simply because he is virtuous, but because he remains present. Jonathan does not flee Saul’s collapse, nor does he resist David’s rise. Instead, he sustains covenant with one and connection with the other, without collapsing into either.
This paper proposes that Jonathan’s steady presence is made possible by Jonathan’s relationship with David, which allows Jonathan to remain engaged with his father Saul while staying grounded in his own integrity. In family systems terms, Jonathan’s relationship with David serves as a “secure base” allowing Jonathan to act as a “differentiated self.”
This interpretation carries both exegetical and pastoral weight. In theological education, we often focus on helping others to either mend or leave unhealthy relationships. However, many congregants and students live in an uncomfortable between-space, choosing to stay, with aging parents, fractured congregations, or cultural systems that constrain movement. While we may pray for our congregants to achieve reconciliation or freedom, it is not often our decision to make. So for those who remain, Jonathan offers a model: not of martyrdom or codependency, but of faithful presence sustained by secure love elsewhere.
For contemporary pastoral settings, Jonathan’s story offers a rich case study in what it means to remain grounded inside anxious systems, not because one is powerless or naive to circumstances, but because one is anchored in something greater. Jonathan represents not only an individual facing hard choices, but a person navigating emotional systems that don’t have clean exits. This is the terrain many pastors, and many of those they serve, know intimately: What holds you steady when leaving isn’t possible, and staying costs you dearly?

Jonathan in Summary

Jonathan appears primarily in 1 Samuel, in relation to his father Saul and his covenant partner David. The following summary presents the major episodes in which Jonathan is an active or central figure, based on the JPS translation unless otherwise noted.
Jonathan first appears commanding a thousand men at Gibeah (1 Sam 13:2). He strikes down a Philistine garrison at Geba (1 Sam 13:3), prompting broader Philistine military response.
In chapter 14, without informing his father, Jonathan initiates an attack on a Philistine outpost with his armor-bearer (1 Sam 14:1–13). The Philistines are thrown into confusion, and Israel achieves military victory (1 Sam 14:14–23).
Unbeknownst to Jonathan, Saul had imposed a ban on eating food until evening (1 Sam 14:24). Jonathan eats honey (1 Sam 14:27). When Saul discovers this, he declares: “Thus and more may God do: You shall be put to death, Jonathan!” (1 Sam 14:44, JPS). The troops intervene: “Shall Jonathan die, who has brought this great victory to Israel? Far be it! As the LORD lives, not a hair of his head shall fall to the ground; for he has brought this day’s victory with God’s help” (1 Sam 14:45, JPS). The people ransom Jonathan.
Following David’s defeat of Goliath, “Jonathan’s soul became bound up with the soul of David; Jonathan loved David as himself” (1 Sam 18:1, JPS).
Jonathan makes a covenant with David (1 Sam 18:3) and gives him his robe, tunic, sword, bow, and belt (1 Sam 18:4).
In 1 Samuel 19:1–7, Saul speaks openly of his intent to kill David. Jonathan intercedes: “Let not Your Majesty wrong his servant David, for he has not wronged you; indeed, all his actions have been very beneficial to you” (1 Sam 19:4, JPS). Saul swears: “As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death” (1 Sam 19:6, JPS), and David is temporarily restored.
In chapter 20, David approaches Jonathan to test whether Saul still intends to kill him (1 Sam 20:1–8). Jonathan swears: “Whatever you say, I will do for you” (1 Sam 20:4, JPS).
They devise a test involving David’s absence from the new moon feast (1 Sam 20:5–7, 18–23). Jonathan will observe Saul’s reaction and communicate the result through a prearranged signal involving arrows (1 Sam 20:20–22).
During the feast, Saul asks about David’s absence. Jonathan replies that David returned to Bethlehem for a family sacrifice (1 Sam 20:28–29). Saul becomes enraged: “You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! I know that you side with the son of Jesse—to your shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness!” (1 Sam 20:30, JPS). Saul accuses Jonathan of forfeiting his own future and throws a spear at him (1 Sam 20:33). Jonathan leaves in anger (1 Sam 20:34).
The next morning, Jonathan carries out the plan, signaling to David that danger remains (1 Sam 20:35–40). They meet privately: “They kissed each other and wept together; David wept the longer” (1 Sam 20:41, JPS). Jonathan says: “Go in peace! For we two have sworn to each other in the name of the LORD: ‘May the LORD be [witness] between you and me, and between your offspring and my offspring, forever!’” (1 Sam 20:42, JPS).
After David flees and is hiding at Horesh, “Jonathan son of Saul arose and went to David at Horesh. He encouraged him in [the name of] God” (1 Sam 23:16, JPS). Jonathan says: “Do not be afraid, for the hand of my father Saul will never touch you. You are going to be king over Israel and I shall be second to you; my father Saul also knows this” (1 Sam 23:17, JPS).
Jonathan and David renew their covenant before the LORD (1 Sam 23:18). This is Jonathan’s final recorded speech.
The Philistines fight Israel at Mount Gilboa. “The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua, sons of Saul” (1 Sam 31:2, JPS). Saul is critically wounded and takes his own life (1 Sam 31:4). The Philistines discover the bodies and display them (1 Sam 31:8–10).

Upon learning of the deaths, David mourns and composes a lament (2 Sam 1:17–27). He declares: “I grieve for you, my brother Jonathan, you were most dear to me. Your love was wonderful to me, more than the love of women” (2 Sam 1:26, JPS). This lament is publicly taught to the people of Judah (2 Sam 1:18).

David honors his covenant with Jonathan by seeking surviving descendants. He finds Mephibosheth, Jonathan’s son (2 Sam 9:3), restores Saul’s property to him, and welcomes him at the royal table: “He shall always eat at my table” (2 Sam 9:7, JPS). David explicitly links this act to Jonathan: “I will show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan” (2 Sam 9:7, JPS).

II. Interpretive Trajectories: What’s Been Seen and Missed
Jonathan is Exemplary
Traditional Christian interpretations often read Jonathan as an exemplar of faithfulness, self-sacrifice, and obedience to God. He is praised for subordinating his claim to the throne to David, particularly if David is to be understood as an ancestor or prototype for Christ.
Walter Brueggemann highlights Jonathan’s “remarkable freedom from self-serving.”[Brueggemann] Robert Alter describes him as exemplifying “the ultimate in selfless devotion.”[Alter] T.H. Jones calls him “a model of loyalty to truth and friendship.”[Jones]
Textual Support:
- 1 Sam 18:1–4: Jonathan’s covenant with David, marked by symbolic self-dispossession
- 1 Sam 19:4–7: Jonathan’s mediation between Saul and David, resulting in temporary peace
- 1 Sam 23:17: Jonathan’s affirmation of David’s kingship and his own subordinate role
- 1 Sam 31: Jonathan’s presence alongside Saul in his final battle
- 2 Sam 9: David’s covenantal care for Mephibosheth, read as extension of Jonathan’s virtue

What It Infers:
- That Jonathan willingly relinquishes a political future he could have claimed
- That his continued presence with Saul reflects filial piety rather than paralysis or entrapment
- That his friendship with David is an ideal of disinterested love
- That his actions consistently embody humility and covenant faithfulness

What It Tends to Overlook:
- 1 Sam 14:43–45: Saul’s threat to execute Jonathan, and the people’s role in saving him
- 1 Sam 20:30–33: Saul’s verbal abuse and physical assault toward Jonathan
- Jonathan’s active subversion of Saul’s plans to kill David (1 Sam 20:35–42)
- The extent to which Jonathan’s covenant with David undermines his own dynasty’s future

What This Interpretation Reveals:
The pious reading highlights Jonathan’s covenantal loyalty and his emotional and spiritual clarity. It offers a consistent moral narrative but struggles to account for the full range of family conflict and emotional complexity the text presents.

The Cautionary Jonathan
In contrast, some interpreters read Jonathan as tragic, a person’s whose value or effectiveness is cut short due to patriotism or excessive commitment.
David M. Gunn refers to him as “the wasted patriot,”[Gunn] a figure whose virtue becomes ineffectual and whose loyalty proves fatal.
Textual Support:
- 1 Sam 14:43–45: Jonathan nearly executed by his father for violating a rash oath
- 1 Sam 20:33: Saul’s violent outburst and physical attack on Jonathan
- 1 Sam 31:2: Jonathan’s death in a battle already lost
- The contrast between Jonathan’s proven military skill (1 Sam 14) and his absence from David’s victorious rise

What It Infers:
- That Jonathan’s death could have been avoided had he aligned with David more fully
- That he failed to exert agency when it most mattered
- That his presence with Saul at Gilboa was not necessity but misplaced loyalty

What It Tends to Overlook:
- The constraints of kinship, geography, and honor in ancient Israel
- Jonathan’s stated theological and political awareness (1 Sam 23:17)
- His relational loyalty not only to Saul, but to Israel and its future
- The presence of his brothers Abinadab and Malchishua at Gilboa (1 Sam 31:2), suggesting this was a collective family choice

What This Interpretation Reveals:
This reading centers cost and consequence. It refuses to romanticize Jonathan’s end and raises important questions about agency, allegiance, and the limits of virtue in disordered systems.

Jonathan is Queer
Queer theologians and biblical scholars have read the covenant between Jonathan and David as expressing a deep and possibly romantic same-sex bond. This reading affirms LGBTQ+ Christians by recovering biblical models of same-sex covenantal love. It is offered not only as academic analysis, but as a site of theological survival and affirmation.
Theodore Jennings and Tom Horner argue that the language of soul-bonding, covenant, kissing, and surpassing love suggests a queer subtext.[Jennings][Horner] Samuel Giere writes: “If there is a relationship depicted in scripture that provides images for a loving relationship between two men… this is it.”[Giere]
Textual Support:
- 1 Sam 18:1: “Jonathan’s soul became bound up with the soul of David” (JPS)
- 1 Sam 18:3–4: Covenant-making and the giving of intimate, symbolic items
- 1 Sam 20:41: “They kissed each other and wept together” (JPS)
- 2 Sam 1:26: “Your love was wonderful to me, more than the love of women” (JPS)
- Covenant language binding their descendants “forever” (1 Sam 20:42; 23:18)

What It Infers:
- That the emotional, physical, and covenantal language in the narrative points toward a relationship of romantic or erotic intimacy
- That Jonathan and David offer a positive biblical example of same-sex love
- That this bond was public, covenantal, and divinely acknowledged

What It Tends to Overlook:
- The family dynamics, abuse, and systemic anxiety within Saul’s household
- Jonathan’s relationship to other figures in the narrative, including his siblings
- The sociopolitical context of Jonathan’s death
- The relational constraints and gendered dynamics not equally available to female figures in the text

What This Interpretation Reveals:
The queer reading foregrounds emotional depth, covenantal intensity, and the theological dignity of same-sex love. It reads against heteronormative assumptions and refuses to minimize the affective and symbolic richness of Jonathan’s bond with David.

In evaluation
Each reading highlights something real, be it virtue, wisdom, or love, but they can treat Jonathan as an isolated figure making autonomous choices. What they miss is the pattern of relational labor: staying present, managing anxiety, and holding two covenants at once.

III. Family Systems Theory as Interpretive Lens
Differentiation and Secure Attachment
While the “family systems” lens is relatively recent in biblical analysis, it expresses a truth that is present throughout the Hebrew Bible: that people are members of families.
Accordingly, family systems theory offers a particular attention to how individuals function in relational webs. Within this view, a “differentiated person” can stay emotionally connected without losing their selfhood. A secure attachment, what Bowlby called a “secure base” is a relationship to a person which enables a person to experience differentiation, especially in otherwise anxious systems.
Jonathan’s covenant with David is this secure base. He returns to it. He draws strength from it. It grounds him enough to stay in a collapsing household without being undone.
Triangulation and Chronic Anxiety
Family systems theory suggests that when two persons within a family system encounter conflict, the conflict may be displaced onto a third person. Jonathan is repeatedly “triangulated” between Saul and David. He absorbs tension, calms Saul, and protects David.
However, family systems theory also suggests that a person who regulates chronic anxiety may eventually come to be blamed for, or targeted by, the system’s anxiety. This would be apparent in repeated violent acts from Saul toward Jonathan.
Cutoff
Family systems theory recognizes that a painful but sometimes necessary way to manage systemic anxiety is through emotional cutoff, or distancing oneself from others either physically or relationally.
Cutoff is often necessary in cases of abuse, threat, or relationships that result in ongoing harm. Individuals who choose cutoff may experience deep guilt and shame over the decision, but also recognize that it may be a necessary cost for a differentiated life, and may paradoxically become more faithful family members as a result of carefully discerned cutoff boundaries.
However, it is also true that harmful dynamics are addressable in many family systems,  and some individuals find it deeply worthwhile to remain emotionally present.
Remaining Present Without Fusion
Jonathan neither cuts off Saul nor fuses with David. His strength is in his differentiated ability to remain emotionally present, honest, and loyal without surrendering clarity. The best expression of this may come at Horesh, when Jonathan affirms David’s kingship but remains by Saul’s side until death.

IV. Jonathan and Family Systems: Textual Evaluation
Family systems theory reads Jonathan as someone whose secure attachment to David enables him to remain present to his father Saul and his brothers through their decline and death. Jonathan is neither simply pious nor simply tragic, but someone doing complex relational work in a highly anxious family system.
This reading builds on and integrates previous interpretations:
From Pious Jonathan:
- 1 Sam 18:1–4: The covenant bond between Jonathan and David is genuine, deep, and sustained
- 1 Sam 23:17: Jonathan’s acceptance that David will be king reflects clarity and commitment, not resignation
- Jonathan’s continued presence with Saul through 1 Sam 31: His loyalty to family is real
From Cautionary Jonathan:
- 1 Sam 14:43–45: Jonathan’s near-death at Saul’s hand establishes pattern of being caught in Saul’s dysfunction
- 1 Sam 20:30–33: Saul’s violence toward Jonathan shows the cost of his triangulated position
- 1 Sam 31:2: Jonathan’s death alongside Saul carries genuine tragedy and loss
From Queer Jonathan:
- 1 Sam 18:1: “Jonathan’s soul became bound up with the soul of David”
- 1 Sam 18:3–4: The exchange of robe, armor, and weapons as intimate covenant-making
- 1 Sam 20:41: “They kissed each other and wept together”
- 2 Sam 1:26: David’s testimony that Jonathan’s love was “wonderful to me, more than the love of women”

Family Systems Adds:
- 1 Sam 23:16: Jonathan “encouraged him in [the name of] God” showing the secure base functions across distance
- The pattern across chapters 18-23: Jonathan mediates, warns, protects David while maintaining relationship with Saul, not choosing sides but managing both relationships
- The presence of brothers Abinadab and Malchishua at Gilboa (1 Sam 31:2): Jonathan dies with family, not alone with Saul
- The troops’ intervention (1 Sam 14:45): Others recognize Jonathan’s value and Saul’s instability, suggesting Jonathan has support beyond immediate family

What It Infers:
- Jonathan had agency in forming covenant with David and choosing to maintain it across time and distance
- The covenant with David functioned as secure relational base that enabled difficult work elsewhere
- Jonathan’s mediation between Saul and David was active relational labor requiring sophistication and emotional capacity
- Jonathan’s clarity about the future (David will be king, Jonathan will be second) allowed him to stay present without denial or fusion
- Jonathan’s presence at Gilboa represented choice to remain with family, enabled by secure base with David
- The relational work Jonathan performed (mediating, warning, strengthening, staying present) was consistent pattern across the narrative

What It Doesn’t Directly Address:
- Theological questions about divine will or whether God “required” Jonathan’s death
- Detailed military strategy and whether different tactical choices at Gilboa were available
- Comprehensive political analysis of succession dynamics in the United Monarchy
- Counterfactual speculation about whether Jonathan could have successfully ruled

This reflects scope: family systems theory explains relational dynamics and how people function within anxious systems, not every theological, military, or political dimension of the narrative.

What Family Systems Reading Reveals

Integration of Previous Readings:
- Jonathan’s loyalty (pious) is sustained through secure attachment, not despite his bond with David but *because of it*
- Jonathan’s vulnerability and costs (cautionary) are real, understood as systemic constraint rather than individual failure
- Jonathan’s covenant with David (queer) is the foundation that enables everything else, not separate from but integral to his capacity to stay with Saul

New Insights
- Why Jonathan can remain with Saul: The secure base with David provides the relational strength that allows Jonathan to stay present to his father’s decline without being consumed by it
- What Jonathan is actually doing: Complex relational work, mediating tension, managing violence, maintaining multiple covenants simultaneously, rather than passive submission or simple resistance
- How the covenant with David functions: Not as escape from family but as foundation that enables continued family engagement
- Why the text shows Jonathan strengthening David at Horesh: The secure base works bidirectionally, Jonathan supports David even while David’s rise displaces Jonathan
- Why Jonathan’s death is neither simply noble nor simply tragic: It’s the outcome of commitment to stay present to family covenant while held secure in another covenant

V. Pastoral-Theological Implications

A blessing for those who stay: Jonathan’s narrative mirrors real-life pastoral and relational dilemmas. Not everyone can leave toxic systems; not everyone will leave toxic systems. Sometimes, even within situations where it does not seem possible to leave, it may still be rewarding to choose to stay, and to have somebody worth staying for.

Reframing “loyalty”: Jonathan’s loyalty is not blind devotion or self-sacrifice at the expense of self. It’s the capacity to remain in relationship with father and brothers while maintaining covenant with David, to stay present to family tragedy while held in secure love. This is loyalty with differentiation, maintaining connection without fusion.

The role of secure attachment in bearing impossible situations: Jonathan’s story suggests that people can endure extraordinary relational difficulty when they have secure base elsewhere. The covenant with David doesn’t solve Jonathan’s bind, but it enables him to remain himself while navigating it.
For caregivers and pastors: Jonathan models relational fidelity under pressure, not naive loyalty, but grounded commitment.
For theological educators: His story offers a space to land in between cutoff and fusion.
For communities in anxiety: His presence becomes a form of resistance, choosing to stay not because of helplessness, but because of love held elsewhere.
Jonathan doesn’t survive, but he is not destroyed. His covenant holds. His clarity endures. He becomes a model of soul-deep faithfulness: presence without collapse, loyalty without illusion, differentiation without disconnection.

VI. Synthesis
Reading Jonathan through the lens of family systems theory offers a reframing of his narrative that integrates insights from prior interpretations while adding analytical and pastoral depth. This approach does not reject previous readings, but recasts them as partial articulations of a more complex relational reality.
1. It accounts for more textual data.
Each of the dominant interpretive traditions captures a genuine element of Jonathan’s story:
- The pious reading sees his loyalty and self-giving love
- The cautionary reading names the cost of his position and the ambiguity of his end
- The queer reading recognizes the emotional and covenantal intensity of his bond with David
A systems reading does not displace these but situates them within a broader frame. Jonathan’s secure attachment to David is what makes his presence with Saul sustainable. His loyalty is not an uncritical virtue, nor a tragic failure, but a function of emotional grounding. His death is not simply a cautionary tale or a martyrdom, but the culmination of a differentiated presence in a system he refused to abandon.
2. It makes visible dynamics other readings leave unnamed.
Where previous interpretations focus on Jonathan’s internal qualities or isolated decisions, family systems theory attends to how he functions inside a relational network under stress. It names:
- The triangulation between Saul and David
- The chronic anxiety within Saul’s household
- The relational labor Jonathan performs to mediate, warn, strengthen, and stay connected
- The secure base that sustains him emotionally
- The differentiation that allows him to remain present without fusing or cutting off

These patterns are visible in the narrative, but are often described in moral or psychological terms without a framework to hold them together. Systems theory brings coherence to what the text already depicts.

3. It generates new pastoral and theological questions.
This reading has significant implications for theological education and pastoral care. It invites further inquiry:
- How do other biblical figures function within anxious systems (Joseph, Tamar, Esther)?
- How does gender affect access to secure attachment and differentiation?
- What forms of faithfulness are possible in systems that cannot be exited?
- What would it mean to preach not just individual virtue, but systemic functioning?

These are questions of real consequence for pastors and theological educators, especially those working with people whose family, cultural, or ecclesial systems offer little room to leave but deep need to survive.

4. It offers theological grounding for faithfulness that often goes unnamed.
Some people stay. Not because they are stuck, or afraid, or unable to imagine another way, but because they are held in covenant elsewhere. They remain in proximity to collapsing systems, difficult families, or failing institutions. They do so not out of dysfunction, but out of relational clarity, sustained by secure attachment that allows them to remain themselves.
Jonathan’s story affirms this kind of presence. His capacity to remain with Saul is not a contradiction of his covenant with David; it is enabled by it. The covenant gives him the inner freedom to stay present, even as the world around him breaks.
His death at Gilboa is not the negation of his love but an expression of it. The covenant held. And because it held, he was not destroyed by the system he chose to remain in.
For those who walk with aging parents, fractured churches, cultural expectations, or family systems that offer no easy exits, Jonathan offers a model of soul-deep faithfulness: presence without collapse, loyalty without self-erasure, love without illusion.

VII. Conclusion
Jonathan should not be read only as a martyr, a tragic son, or a queer icon, though each of these frames names something true.
He is also a figure of differentiated resilience in a collapsing family system. His story models how one can remain present to multiple loyalties, sustained by a covenant that grounds rather than consumes.
In other words, whether or not he has the choice to stay in his family, he finds strength in love.
